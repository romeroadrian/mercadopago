MercadoPago Gem
===============

Developed and maintained by [Kauplus](http://www.kauplus.com).

This is a Ruby client for all the services offered by [MercadoPago](http://www.mercadopago.com).

You should read the MercadoPago API documentation before you use this gem. This gem works with hashes and only deals with requests/responses. That's why you will need an understanding of their services.

You can read the documentation of the MercadoPago API here:
* Portuguese: https://developers.mercadopago.com/integracao-checkout
* Spanish: https://developers.mercadopago.com/integracion-checkout

Installation
------------

mercadopago 2.0.0+ needs Ruby 1.9+. Version 1.0.2 runs fine with Ruby 1.8.

To install the last version of the gem:

    gem install mercadopago

If you are using bundler, add this to your Gemfile:

    gem 'mercadopago'

Access Credentials
------------------

To use this gem, you will need the client_id and client_secret for a MercadoPago account.

In any case, this gem will not store this information. In order to find out your MercadoPago credentials, you can go here:

* Brasil: https://www.mercadopago.com/mlb/ferramentas/aplicacoes
* Argentina: https://www.mercadopago.com/mla/herramientas/aplicaciones

How to use
----------

### Client creation

The first thing to do is create a client. The client will authenticate with MercadoPago and will allow you to interact with the MercadoPago API.

    # Use your credentials
    client_id = '1234'
    client_secret = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

    mp_client = MercadoPago::Client.new(client_id, client_secret)

If any error ocurred while authenticating with MercadoPago, an AccessError will be raised. If nothing goes wrong, no errors are raised and you are ready to use the API.

### Payment Creation

Your request will need a hash to explain what the payment is for. For example:

    data = {
      external_reference: "OPERATION-ID-1234",
      items: [
        {
          id:           "Código 123",
          title:        "Example T-Shirt",
          description:  "Red XL T-Shirt",
          quantity:     1,
          unit_price:   10.50,
          currency_id:  "BRL",
          picture_url:  "http://www.site.com/image/123.png"
        }
      ],
      payer: {
        name:     "John",
        surname:  "Mikel",
        email:    "buyer@email.com"
      },
      back_urls: {
        pending: "https://www.site.com/pending",
        success: "http://www.site.com/success",
        failure: "http://www.site.com/failure"
      }
    }

    payment = mp_client.create_preference(data)

If everything worked out alright, you will get a response like this:

    {
      "payment_methods"    => {},
      "init_point"         => "https://www.mercadopago.com/mlb/checkout/pay?pref_id=abcdefgh-9999-9999-ab99-999999999999",

        "failure"=> "http://www.site.com/failure"
      },
      "sponsor_id" => nil,

        "email"   => "buyer@email.com",
        "name"    => "John",

      },
      "items" => [
        {
          "id"          => "Código 123",

        }
      ],
      "client_id"   => "963",
      "marketplace" => "NONE"
    }

### Payment Status Verification

To check the payment status you will need the payment ID. Only then you can call the [MercadoPago IPN](https://developers.mercadopago.com/api-ipn).

    # Use the payment ID received on the IPN.
    payment_id = '987654321'

    notification = mp_client.notification(payment_id)

You will get a response like this one:

    {
      "collection" => {
        "id"                  => 987654321,
        "site_id"             => "MLB",
        "operation_type"      => "regular_payment",
        "order_id"            => nil,
        "external_reference"  => "OPERATION-ID-1234",
        "status"              => "approved",
        "status_detail"       => "approved",
        "payment_type"        => "credit_card",
        "date_created"        => "2012-05-05T14:22:43Z",
        "last_modified"       => "2012-05-05T14:35:13Z",
        "date_approved"       => "2012-05-05T14:22:43Z",
        "money_release_date"  => "2012-05-19T14:22:43Z",
        "currency_id"         => "BRL",
        "transaction_amount"  => 10.50,
        "shipping_cost"       => 0,
        "total_paid_amount"   => 10.50,
        "finance_charge"      => 0,
        "net_received_amount" => 0,
        "marketplace"         => "NONE",
        "marketplace_fee"     => nil,
        "reason"              => "Example T-Shirt",
        "payer" => {
          "id"          => 543219876,
          "first_name"  => "John",
          "last_name"   => "Mikel",
          "nickname"    => "JOHNMIKEL",
          "phone" => {
            "area_code" => nil,
            "number"    => "551122334455",
            "extension" => nil
          },
          "email" => "buyer@email.com",
          "identification" => {
            "type"    => nil,
            "number"  => nil
          }
        },

          "nickname"  => "BILLRECEIVER"
        }
      }
    }

### Search in the collections

To search over the collections (payments that you may be processing) you need to create a hash with the params that you want to search for an send it to the search method of the client instance.

    # Create a hash to search for
    search_hash = { external_reference: 'OPERATION-ID-1234' }

    search = mp_client.search(search_hash)

You will get a response like this one:

    {
      "results"=>[
        {
          "collection" => {
            "marketplace"   =>"NONE",
            "sponsor_id"    =>nil,
            "status"        => "approved",
            "status_detail" => "approved",
            "payer" => {
              "id"          => 543219876,
              "first_name"  => "John",
              "last_name"   => "Mikel",

                "type"    => nil,
                "number"  => nil
              }
            },
            "currency_id"         => "BRL",

### Sandbox mode

The sandbox mode can be enabled/disabled as follows:

    mp_client.sandbox(true)  # Enables sandbox
    mp_client.sandbox(false) # Disables sandbox

### Recurring Payment Creation

Your request will need a hash to explain what the recurring payment is for. For example:

    data = {
      payer_email:        "xxx@test.com",
      back_url:           "http://www.site.com/return",
      reason:             "Monthly Magazine",
      external_reference: "OPERATION-ID-1234",
      auto_recurring: {
        frequency:          1,
        frequency_type:     "months",
        transaction_amount: 12.55,
        currency_id:        "BRL"
      }
    }

If everything worked out alright, you will get a response like this:

    {
       "id"                 => "f8ad8asd8asd98asd89add980",
       "payer_id"           => 131231333,

      "last_modified": "2012-08-31T11:50:26.648-04:00"
    }



### Errors

Errors will also be hashes with status code, message and error key.

For example, if you request payment method status for an invalid operation, you will see something like this:

    {
     "message"  => "Resource not found",
     "error"    => "not_found",
     "status"   => 404,
     "cause"    => []
    }

### Tests

This gem has tests for a few methods. To check if it is working properly, just run:

    rake test
